This is an implementation of a convex hull algorithm, found in *Computational
Geometry: Algorithms and Applications* by Mark de Berg et al. It was created
as an assignment for a Computational Geometry course at UTRGV.

The program creates random numbers between a range indicated in the code,
applies the convex hull, and writes the random points and the points
belonging to the convex hull in an excel file. This points can then be
plotted using another script or sofltware (I used Geoebra). This is repeated
for every range indicated in a list of sizes.
